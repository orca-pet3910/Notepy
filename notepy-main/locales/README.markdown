# How to translate Notepy:
Get a GNU-Gettext (PO-File) compatible Po-Editor (e.g. PoEdit) and open the base.pot. Once you finished translating, create a directory with your language-code (for example "de" for German), inside of that folder create a folder called "LC_MESSAGES", inside of that folder place your base.po. Compile the base.po into a .mo file (base.mo) and place it in the same folder like the base.po. After that, submit a pull request.
